                 </ul>

            <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
                 <ol>

                    <li>Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until large enough to line a 23cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Trim the excess pastry from around the edge, then line the pastry case with baking parchment, fill with baking beans and chill for 30 mins.</li>
                    <li>Heat oven to 200C/375F/gas 6. Bake the pastry case for 15 mins, then carefully lift out the parchment and beans, and bake for 5 mins more or until biscuity<b>*</b>. Meanwhile, beat the eggs, cream, sugar and vanilla together, then strain into a jug.</li>
                    <li>Scatter the gooseberries into the pastry case, then pour in the vanilla custard mixture. Bake for 35-40 mins until the custard is set<b>*</b> and the gooseberries are tender. Cool a little before serving, or cool completely and eat cold, dusted with icing sugar, if you like.</li>
                
                </ol>
                <p><b>*NOTES*</b></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Crust will not bake much more once filled. Crust should appear dry and have just barely begun browning.</li>
                        <li>Custard is set when the center jiggles <em>slightly</em> when shake, but the edges don't move. Overbaking will give an eggy flavor and is worse than underbaking!</li>
                    </ol>
