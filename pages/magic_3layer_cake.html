            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
                 <ul>
                     <li><b>4 eggs</b> seperated, room temperature</li>
                     <li><b>150g (3/4 cup)</b> granulated sugar</li>
                     <li><b>1 tsp</b> vanilla extract</li>
                     <li><b>1/2 cup (1 stick)</b> <em>unsalted</em> butter</li>
                     <li><b>90 g (3/4 cup)</b> all-purpose flour</li>
                     <li><b>500ml (2 cups)</b> whole milk, room temperature</li>

                 </ul>

            <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325F/160C (standard oven / fan forced or convection)</li>
                    <li>Butter a 8" x 8" / 20cm x 20cm square cake tin</li>
                    <li>Beat egg whites<b>*</b> with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Place the egg yolks and sugar in a separate bowl and beat until it turns pale yellow - about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the vanilla extract and butter and beat until well incorporated - about 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the flour and beat until just combined. <i>Alternatively, fold the flour in.</i></li>
                    <li>Pour the milk in slowly while beating, and beat until well combined (or if using a hand held mixer, add 1/4 milk at a time, beating in between).</li>
                    <li>Use a spatula to fold in the egg whites in the batter, one third at a time, until just incorporated. You don't want to knock the air out of the egg whites. Don't worry if there are a few egg white lumps in the batter. The batter should be very thin.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin.</li>
                    <li>Bake until the top is golden brown and the cake does not "jiggle" when you gently shake the tin - around 40 to 50 minutes<b>*</b>. Check the cake at 30 minutes - if the top is already golden brown but the cake is not yet set (i.e. it jiggles), cover loosely with foil and return to the oven, 10 minutes at a time, until set.</li>
                    <li>Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack. Cool completely before serving.</li>
                    <li>Cut into bars. Keep refrigerated when not serving.</li>

                    

                </ol>
                <p><b>*NOTES*</b></p>
                    <ol>

                        <li>For egg whites to beat properly, there can be <em>no fat in the bowl or on the whisk.</em> You can use white vinegar to wipe down the bowl and whisk. This should remove any trace amounts.</li>
                        <li>The safest way to get the baking time right is to follow these directions:</li>
                            <ul>

                                <li>The cake is ready when the top is golden brown and the cake doesn't "jiggle" when you gently shake the pan. If it jiggles, there is still raw batter inside.</li>
                                <li>To get the bake time right, check it first at 30 minutes. If the top is golden brown, cover loosely with foil and return to the oven until the cake is set. Check every 10 minutes - any longer, and you'll risk the cake overcooking.</li>
                                
                            </ul>
                    </ol>
